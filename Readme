This repo contains my the spreadsheet modeling of some problems that I learned as a part of a graduate level course MGT219 : Spreadsheet Modeling for Business Analytic,
offered by the A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management, University of California, Riverside. 

The main reference of the problems solved using spreadsheets is the famous book ``Business Analytics: The Art of Modeling with Spreadsheets'', by Stephen G. Powell and

2. Network Optimization 

3. Non-linear Optimization.
