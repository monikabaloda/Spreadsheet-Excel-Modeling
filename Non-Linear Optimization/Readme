In this section, we consider non-linear optimization. Our objective function and or contraint(s) may take non-linear form in this type of optimization. 

It is a generalization of the linear programming not restricting the form of contraints or objective function. 

The problem I consider here is a financial modeling which they managers must determine how many sales representatives they will assign to seven product lines.

The solution of this problem I learned from Prof. Long Gao of UC Riverside.
